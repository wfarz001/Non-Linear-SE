A very important nonlinear equation in science is the Nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLS)
The following three parts are solved based on the reference papers. Please refer to pdf files for detailed explanation of the problems and solution.
The Three parts are:

1. A numerical scheme that will successfully follow the evolution of the exact 1-soliton solution

2.  The 2-soliton dynamics and show that the post-collision solitons retain they shape and velocity

3.  First verify analytically that S0(t) and S2(t) are indeed conserved.Plot the numerical solution to these integrals. Comment on your numerical accuracy.
